# Hosting Backup Alert
Aegir module that sends notifications when no recent backups exist.

Useful in case a site systematically fails to backup (or in case the backup queue fails).

hosting_site_backup_manager is not necessary but highly recommended:
https://drupal.org/project/hosting_site_backup_manager

Really it doesn't make much sense to use this module without the backup queue that that module provides.

For now only this module only has an Aegir2 version.
